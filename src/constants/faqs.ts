    answer:
      "Ensure your camera lens is clean and not covered by dirt or fingerprints. Make sure there is enough light in your surroundings. Position the barcode within the scanner frame and hold it steady. If the barcode is too small or blurry, try zooming in or adjusting the angle.",

  {
    question: "What should I do if the barcode is not recognized?",
    answer: "Ensure the product is supported in the store’s system (some items may not be registered). Try scanning from a different angle or adjust the distance. If scanning still fails, use the manual search option to find the product by name."

    question: "Why is the app taking too long to scan?",
    answer:
